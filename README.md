## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/SteveProkovas/Game-of-Chance-Simulator.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```sh
   cd Game-of-Chance-Simulator
   ```

## üìä Educational Purpose

This program is designed to be educational, allowing users to experiment with different parameters and understand the concept of probability in casino games. It provides a hands-on way to explore probability theory and its application in real-world scenarios.

## Dice Rolling

While the simulator predominantly focuses on probability distributions for simplicity, we can extend its capabilities to incorporate continuous distributions. By leveraging NumPy's capabilities, we can generate random samples from a normal distribution and analyze their statistical properties.

```python
# Generate random samples from a normal distribution
samples = np.random.normal(mean, std_deviation, num_samples)
```

Here, `mean` and `std_deviation` represent the mean and standard deviation of the distribution, while `num_samples` denotes the number of samples to generate. We can then analyze these samples using advanced statistical techniques, unlocking deeper insights into the underlying probability distribution.

```python
# Analyze the samples using advanced statistical techniques
mean_sample = np.mean(samples)
std_deviation_sample = np.std(samples)
```

The `np.mean()` and `np.std()` functions compute the mean and standard deviation of the generated samples, respectively. These statistics provide valuable insights into the properties of the normal distribution and its relevance to the simulated scenario.

## Coin Flipping

This code defines a function `flip_coin` that simulates flipping a coin with a bias towards heads or tails, controlled by probability.

1. **Probability of Heads:**
   - The function takes an optional `bias` argument, representing the probability of getting heads on a single flip (between 0 and 1).
   - If no bias is provided, it defaults to 0.5 (fair coin, equal chance of heads or tails).
2. **Early Termination for Extreme Biases:**
   - If the `bias` is very close to 0 (almost guaranteed tails) or 1 (almost guaranteed heads), the function avoids unnecessary looping.
     - It directly returns a dictionary with all tails or all heads depending on the bias.
3. **Simulating Flips with Randomness:**
   - The function uses the `random.random()` function to generate random numbers between 0 and 1 for each flip.
   - It compares this random number to the `heads_probability`:
     - If the random number is less than `heads_probability` (based on the bias), it counts it as a heads.
     - This approach leverages the inherent randomness of the `random` module to simulate the coin flips based on the specified probability of heads.
4. **Tracking Results:**
   - The function keeps track of the number of heads encountered during the simulation.
   - Finally, it returns a dictionary containing the number of heads and tails (calculated from total flips and heads count).

**Understanding the Simulation:**

Imagine flipping a coin with a hidden bias. This code simulates that process by:

1. Defining the probability of heads (`heads_probability`).
2. For each flip:
   - Generating a random "fate" number between 0 and 1.
   - If the "fate" number falls within the `heads_probability` range (biased towards heads), it counts as heads.
   - This reflects the idea that the higher the `heads_probability`, the more likely the random number will fall within that range, resulting in more heads in the simulation.

By repeating this process for the specified number of flips (`num_flips`), the function provides a simulated outcome based on the given probability of heads.


## Card Game : Rummy

Of course! When writing equations for a README on GitHub, it's best to use Markdown formatting. Here's how you can present the equations in a clear and readable manner:

1. **Probability of Drawing Specific Cards**:

   ```
   P(C) = (Number of desired cards in the deck) / (Total number of cards remaining in the deck)
   ```

   This equation calculates the probability of drawing a specific card from the deck. You divide the number of desired cards (i.e., cards that would benefit the player) by the total number of cards remaining in the deck.

2. **Probability of Completing Melds**:

   ```
   P(M) = (Number of remaining cards needed to complete meld) / (Total number of cards remaining in the deck)
   ```

   This equation calculates the probability of completing a specific meld, such as a set or a run. You divide the number of remaining cards needed to complete the meld by the total number of cards remaining in the deck.

3. **Optimal Strategy Based on Probabilities**:

   In a README, you can briefly mention concepts like Expected Value (EV), the Minimax Algorithm, and Monte Carlo Simulation without presenting specific equations. Instead, you can provide a high-level explanation of how these concepts can be applied to make strategic decisions in the game.

   For example:
   
   - **Expected Value (EV)**: Calculate the expected value of different actions (e.g., drawing a card, discarding a card) based on their potential outcomes and the probabilities of those outcomes. Choose the action with the highest expected value.

   - **Minimax Algorithm**: Determine the best move that maximizes your chances of winning while minimizing the opponent's chances in a competitive setting.

   - **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Simulate multiple future game states based on different possible actions and their associated probabilities. Evaluate the outcomes of these simulations to inform decision-making.
