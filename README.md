## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/SteveProkovas/Game-of-Chance-Simulator.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```sh
   cd Game-of-Chance-Simulator
   ```

## üéÆ Available Games

- **Dice Rolling**: Simulate rolling one or more dice with a specified number of sides on each die.

While the simulator predominantly focuses on probability distributions for simplicity, we can extend its capabilities to incorporate continuous distributions. By leveraging NumPy's capabilities, we can generate random samples from a normal distribution and analyze their statistical properties.

```python
# Generate random samples from a normal distribution
samples = np.random.normal(mean, std_deviation, num_samples)
```

Here, `mean` and `std_deviation` represent the mean and standard deviation of the distribution, while `num_samples` denotes the number of samples to generate. We can then analyze these samples using advanced statistical techniques, unlocking deeper insights into the underlying probability distribution.

```python
# Analyze the samples using advanced statistical techniques
mean_sample = np.mean(samples)
std_deviation_sample = np.std(samples)
```

The `np.mean()` and `np.std()` functions compute the mean and standard deviation of the generated samples, respectively. These statistics provide valuable insights into the properties of the normal distribution and its relevance to the simulated scenario.

- **Coin Flipping**: Simulate flipping a coin a specified number of times.
- **Card Drawing**: Simulate drawing a specified number of cards from a standard deck of cards.

## üìä Educational Purpose

This program is designed to be educational, allowing users to experiment with different parameters and understand the concept of probability in casino games. It provides a hands-on way to explore probability theory and its application in real-world scenarios.
